# BodyWeight Linear Mixed Model Analysis

## Overview

This project conducts a linear mixed model analysis on the BodyWeight
dataset from the `nlme` package in R. The analysis investigates the
effects of diet and time on rat body weights, accounting for individual
rat variability.

## Dependencies

- R (version 4.0.0 or higher recommended)
- lme4
- lmerTest
- nlme (for dataset)
- ggplot2

## Data

The BodyWeight dataset from the nlme package contains longitudinal data
of ratsâ€™ body weights measured over time under different diet
treatments.
